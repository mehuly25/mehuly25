1. There's so much more to codes than to words, that I keep weaving them till the nest is strong.
2. What keeps my notebooks filling - Machine Learning and Data Science. 
3. Indelible as always, my sunsets are well defined by a soothing cup of coffee, a vintage book, and some hands-down algorithm.

### Yellowing pages with subtle words~

"And I'd sit, with  ingrained pots and dark brushes,

 Doodling codes, while the sun rusts down,
 
 To a tranquil hush of immense life.
 
 Embedding a perfect end to the day..."
