### Prologue~

1. There's so much to codes than to words, that I keep weaving them till the nest is strong. 🍃🍃
2. What keeps my notebooks filling - Machine Learning and Data Science. 
3. Indellible as always, my sunsets are well defined by a soothing cup of coffee, a vintage book, and some hands-down algorithm. 🌻🌻

### Scribbled muses

"And I'd sit, with vintage pots and dark feathers,

Dribbling codes, while the sun rusts down,

To a tranquil hush of immense life.

Etching a perfect end to the day..." ☀🌞
